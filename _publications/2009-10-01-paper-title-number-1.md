excerpt: "This review proposes a mechanism-aware framework for deploying machine learning throughout rechargeable ion battery research, focusing on the end-to-end ML workflow, interpretable algorithm/technology selection, and applications to intercalation electrodes, conversion electrodes, and electrolyte design; it also outlines challenges (e.g., data scarcity, mechanism distortion) and opportunities from diffusion models, transformer frameworks, large language models, and autonomous laboratories."
