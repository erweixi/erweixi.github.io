excerpt: 'This paper focuses on the hard carbon anode of sodium-ion batteries and emphasizes the "data statistics + machine learning" data-driven approach: by mining literature data to construct a database of "precursor - preparation parameters - microstructure - electrochemical performance", and using microstructure parameters (such as Vtotal, La, Lc, SSA, d002, ID/IG), preparation parameters (precursor type, carbonization temperature) and test conditions as input features, with ICE, reversible capacity and reversible platform capacity as prediction targets. This paper uses Mice Forest based on random forest to interpolate missing data to improve data integrity; for different targets, it trains random forest models and uses Bayesian optimization to tune parameters, and evaluates generalization ability with 5-fold cross-validation; then uses SHAP to explain model contributions, quantifying the influence of carbonization temperature and key microstructure parameters on ICE/ capacity/platform capacity, thereby converting "black box prediction" into interpretable rules that can be used for the controllable design and parameter selection of hard carbon microstructure.'
