excerpt: "This review first analyzes the advantages of machine learning in the design of rechargeable battery materials, and explains the overall process of applying machine learning in such materials as well as the related interpretability techniques. Based on the classification analysis of different battery types, it elaborately explains which methods should be used for the analysis of various current battery materials. Finally, it looks forward to the future and points out the opportunities brought by large language models and reinforcement learning-driven automatic laboratories."
