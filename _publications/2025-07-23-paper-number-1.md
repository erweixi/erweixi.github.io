excerpt: "This review first analyzes the advantages of machine learning in the design of rechargeable battery materials, and explains the overall process of applying machine learning in such materials as well as the related interpretability techniques. Based on the classification analysis of different battery types, it elaborately explains which methods should be used for the analysis of various current battery materials. Finally, it looks forward to the future and points out the opportunities brought by large language models and reinforcement learning-driven automatic laboratories."

This review provides a systematic roadmap for integrating machine learning (ML) into rechargeable battery research. It distills a mechanism-aware framework and standardized design rules to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and experimental validation.

### Standardized Workflow
 The paper defines an end-to-end ML pipeline covering data collection, imputation techniques such as Mice Forest, and feature engineering to establish a shared vocabulary for reproducibility in battery informatics.

### Interpretability and Insight:
 We analyze the balance between explicit models like Symbolic Regression and implicit models such as Neural Networks. The work demonstrates how tools including SHAP and Variable Importance Measures extract actionable physical insights from complex architectures.

### Multi-Scenario Guidance
 Tailored methodologies are provided for three critical domains consisting of intercalation electrodes, conversion electrodes, and electrolyte design.

### Strategic Outlook
 The review addresses critical bottlenecks such as data defects and mechanism distortion. It serves as an instructive guide for implementing next-generation AI for Science (AI4S) technologies, including Large Language Models for literature mining, Diffusion Models for inverse material design, and Reinforcement Learning to drive autonomous laboratories.
