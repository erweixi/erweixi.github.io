I am a graduate student at Tianjin University, expecting to graduate in Autumn 2027. My research focuses on improving material performance through artificial intelligence. I am currently seeking fully-funded PhD opportunities for Fall 2027.

Research Direction
======
My research focuses on accelerating materials design through **AI-driven methodologies**. I have extensive experience in applying **interpretable machine learning** to battery systems. My previous work includes contributing to the design of hard carbon materials for sodium-ion batteries, which resulted in a second authored publication in *Progress in Materials Science*(IF ~37). Additionally, I authored a comprehensive review on the **integration of AI in rechargeable batteries**, published as the first author in *Advanced Energy Materials*(IF ~27).

Currently, I am **leading a research team** focusing on two synergistic frontiers in energy materials: **the Machine Learning Driven Design of Single-Atom Catalysts** and **the High-throughput Screening of catalysts using Large Language Models** for Lithium-Sulfur batteries.

1. ML for SAC Design: I have developed a specialized machine learning process that **establishes the correlation between catalyst electronic structure characteristics and capacity retention rates**. This approach provides a robust design principle for catalysts in conversion-type battery systems.

2. LLM for High-throughput Screening: To accelerate catalyst discovery for Li-S batteries, I proposed a novel **two-step fine-tuning method** for LLMs. This strategy, utilizing a teacher-student architecture, significantly reduces computational overhead and increases screening speed while maintaining high accuracy.

Research Skill
======
1. Research Problem Translation :I possess a strong ability to combine complex physicochemical challenges with AI technology. Instead of blindly applying models, I excel at **Translating Scientific Challenges into Computational Workflows**
A prime example is my work on **Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) battery catalyst design**:
- **Problem Formulation**: Identifying **capacity decay** as the key limiting factor in conversion-type batteries, I initially sought to model the quantitative relationship between material descriptors and decay rates.
- **Strategic Pivot**: Upon discovering that the high complexity of the data limited the accuracy of standard regression, I **strategically pivoted** the methodology. I redefined the prediction target from a regression of decay rates to a **classification of capacity retention**, significantly enhancing model robustness.
- **Mechanism Elucidation**: Going beyond simple screening, I utilized **interpretability technologies** to decipher the "black box." I successfully transformed ML-derived correlations into **causal insights**, grounding the computational findings in verifiable **electrochemical mechanisms**.

2. Orchestrating Large-Scale Student Collaboration : I currently serve as **the de facto project lead** for a team of **8 junior researchers** (1 junior master student and 7 undergraduates). I excel at decomposing complex machine learning workflows into executable modules for novices, ensuring high-quality output while fostering a collaborative research environment.
- **From Novice to Top-Tier Publication**: I successfully guided a junior student with **zero prior research experience** to co-author a high-impact review paper in **Advanced Materials**. I structured the entire writing framework and provided academic coaching, bridging the gap between her initial lack of domain knowledge and the rigorous standards of top journals.
- **Multi-Stream Team Management**: Managing two parallel projects which are LLM-based screening and ML-driven analysis, I **coordinate the daily workflows of 7 undergraduate students**. I assign different tasks to each person based on their individual circumstances, and regularly check the progress of the project to ensure that it can be completed on time.
